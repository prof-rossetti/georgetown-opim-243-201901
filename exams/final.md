# Final Exam

## Description

The final exam is designed to evaluate students' knowledge of programming concepts and software development practices.

The exam will be administered during the final class period. The exam will be administered in paper format, so students should remember to bring a pen or pencil.

The exam consists primarily of free-response questions, but may also contain multiple-choice and matching questions.

Details about the contents of the final exam will be announced during a final exam preparation session. But generally, anything in the notes, slides, or projects is fair game. The following concepts and techniques are of particular importance:

  + [Datatypes](/notes/python/datatypes), with focus on [Lists](/notes/python/datatypes/lists.md) and [Dictionaries](/notes/python/datatypes/dictionaries.md)
  + [Control Flow](/notes/python/control-flow.md)
  + [Functions](/notes/python/functions.md)

Students may consult these exams from previous semesters in an effort to understand the kinds of questions that might be asked:

  + [Final Exam (Summer 2017)](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201706/blob/master/exams/final/NYU-INFO-2335-70-Final-Exam.pdf)

> NOTE: these previous exams were for a 3 credit class including technology management material, so the final exam for this class will be different / abbreviated, but many of the programming questions will be similar.

## Submission Instructions

Each student should hand-in their exam booklet to the professor when finished.

## Evaluation Methodology

The relative weights of each question on the exam will be denoted on the exam's cover page.
