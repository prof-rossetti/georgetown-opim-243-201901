# "Urban Lunch Company" Business Process Descriptions

## Menu Update Process

After the regional manager creates a new menu and executives sign-off on the menu, the company prints thousands of paper copies to be distributed to customers in each location, as well as two sets of wall-sized menu boards (one primary and one back-up) to be hung in each location.

After printing, the company arranges for a rental van to transport the menu boards to each location, and pays employees overtime to receive and install the new menu.

Sometimes the office supply company misprints the menus, in which case, the employees alert an executive to coordinate re-printing.

## Lunch Service Process

### Customer Intake Phase

Customers enter the store through two glass doors.

Customers wait in line to order a salad, unless there is no line.

### Salad Ordering Phase

Customers pass a printed menu hanging on the wall as they move through the queue.
  The menu lists all available salad options, including a number of seasonal salads and signature salads, as well as the option to create a custom salad from a number of listed ingredients.

Upon reaching the front of the queue, a salad-maker/salad-preparer prompts the customer for a salad order.

Some customers order a single salad. Others place an order for multiple salads (i.e. ordering on behalf of co-workers).

Usually a single salad-maker will prepare all the salads for a single customer before attending to the next customer. Sometimes multiple salad-makers operate simultaneously.

Some customers order pre-prepared signature salads or non-salad items (e.g. soft serve yogurt, bottled water, hard-boiled eggs, and soft drinks). Customers who do not require salad preparation are not required to wait in the salad preparation line, and either wait in a different line, or skip to the payment phase.

### Salad Preparation Phase

The salad-maker prepares a salad to fulfill the order.

Some customers continue to glance behind their shoulders at the menu during salad preparation.

Customers who order a signature salad sometimes choose to make substitutions and additions to their order during the preparation phase. For each substitution or addition, the salad-preparer notifies the customer of any price overages (e.g. "cauliflower costs $1.60 extra, is that OK?" and "you have two items remaining").

Customers who order custom salads participate in a similar process of
 providing verbal preparation instructions to the salad-maker
 and responding to information about price overages.

### Payment Phase

When the salad-maker is done preparing the salad, the customer proceeds to the payment phase.

There are two payment stations,
 each represented by a computer with barcode-scanning and credit-card processing hardware,
 and each operated by a separate attendant.

The salad-preparer communicates the price and nature of each salad to the payment station attendant, who enters the data into the computer.

After an invoice is prepared by the computer, the payment attendant communicates the total price to the customer and prompts the customer to choose a payment method.

Some customers pay with cash, some with credit cards, and some with a mobile app that contains pre-registered credit card information.

The customer presents payment to the payment attendant, and upon authorization of successful payment, the attendant hands a printed invoice to the customer.

### Customer Exit Phase

After paying for their salad(s), the customer(s) either
 sit down inside the store to eat,
 sit outside to eat,
 or leave the premises.
