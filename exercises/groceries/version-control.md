# "Groceries" Version Control Exercise

## Objectives

Practice incorporating version control into your development process.

## Setup

[Install a Git client](/notes/git.md#installation) if you have not yet already done so. You'll use this chosen Git client to perform version control tasks below.

Take this time to create a new repository on GitHub.com called something like "groceries-exercise". We'll refer to this as your "remote project repository".

Clone or download the remote project repository onto your local machine, perhaps on your Desktop. We'll refer to this as your "local project repository".

Navigate to your local project repository from the command-line.

Within the local project repository, create and save a new file called `groceries.py` and place inside some example Python code like `print("Hello")`.

Create a new virtual environment named something like "groceries-env" and activate it. Then from inside the virtual environment, execute the Python script to see it print.

Finally, make your first commit with a message like "Setup project repository", and push these changes to GitHub. Once you see these changes reflected in your remote project repository on GitHub.com, you are ready to start the project development process.

## Development

Revisit the ["Groceries" Exercise](/exercises/groceries.md). Work through each of the ["Groceries" Exercise Checkpoints](/exercises/groceries.md#checkpoints) individually, committing your changes after implementing each.

By the time you are done, you will have produced a complete version history similar to this [example history](https://github.com/s2t2/groceries-project/commits/master).

> NOTE: The point about this example is not about the code it uses, but rather how it was developed incrementally. Feel free to implement whatever code you'd like to solve the checkpoint challenges, and don't feel constrained by the code contained in the example solution. If you previously submitted this exercise, you can leverage your previous submission, or you can start again from scratch - the choice is yours!

## Submission

To submit your exercise:

  1. Push your local project repository to GitHub, so you can visit your remote project repository at a URL like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/groceries-exercise`.
  2. Fork the ["upstream" course repository](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/georgetown-opim-243-201901) (or refresh your existing fork).
  3. Update your forked course repository's ["Shopping Cart" Submissions CSV file](submissions.csv).
to include your GitHub username and your project repository's URL.
  4. Submit a Pull Request for your forked course repository's changes to be accepted into the "upstream" course repository.
